# Voice actress' portfolio 🎤

Hi 👋 Jiro Jasmin here.  
This project is a web portfolio of a German voice actress 🎤  
This is a professional project for an actual client.
  
This project is made with the headless CMS *Strapi*, which offers a custom admin panel to manage the data, accessible via an API.

This repository doesn't include any data (textual contents) as it is stored on a different repository on Heroku, and managed by Strapi,  
which means the UI and the data are completely independent entities connected together.  
The media files (images and audios here) are hosted on Cloudinary and connected with the Strapi database.  
This allows more flexibility and security for the project.  

## 🔧 Tools

- React with Next.js
- Strapi CMS
- Sass (SCSS)
- Axios for server-side generation to fetch data


## 🪄 Features

- BEM naming conventions for more optimized and flexible SCSS
- Static pages generated by Next.js for SEO

- Custom panel made with Strapi to easily add new content

## ⚠️ If you download this repository, make sure to  

### 1. Download Next.js and the dependencies listed in *package-lock.json*

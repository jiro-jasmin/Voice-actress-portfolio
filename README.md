Hi 👋 Jiro Jasmin here.  
This project is a web portfolio of a German voice actress 🎤  
This is a professional project still in development.  

Check the SEO-oriented landing page, or scroll through the projects in dynamic animated cards for the menu.
This project is made with the headless CMS *Strapi*, which offers a custom admin panel to manage the data, accessible via an API.

This repository doesn't include any data (i.e the images and blog posts contents) as it is stored and managed by Strapi,  
which means the UI and the data are completely independent entities and should be hosted on two different servers.  
This allows more flexibility and security for the project.  

## 🔧 Tools

- React with Next.js
- Strapi CMS
- Sass (SCSS)
- Axios for static generation with default data
- SWR for client-side data fetching

## 🪄 Features

- BEM naming conventions for more optimized and flexible SCSS
- Static pages generated by Next.js for SEO
- Calls the Strapi API on each load for fresh data
- Custom panel made with Strapi to easily add new content

## ⚠️ If you download this repository, make sure to  

### 1. Download Next.js and the dependencies listed in *package-lock.json*

### 2. Download Strapi and add your own data (with the same content type to access it!)
 
Please note that you will need to create a dotenv (*.env*) file with the variable of your own Strapi public URL!

## 📰 About this project  
  
Please note that I am still developing this project as of today, so there might be many changes to come in the next weeks. This is still one of my first professional projects with an actual client. 👨‍💼
It has been produced according to functional and technical specifications agreed with the client, under an agile method using Trello, Zoom and IRL meetings.

In any case, I am still open for any reviews or thoughts, so please do not hesitate to tell me
